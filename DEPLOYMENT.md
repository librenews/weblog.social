## Option 3: Vercel (Serverless) âš¡

Good for low-traffic usage with serverless functions.

### Steps:
1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel` (or `yarn global add vercel`)
2. Run `vercel` in your project directory
3. Follow the prompts

### Build Configuration:
Vercel will automatically detect the build setup. If needed, you can specify:
- **Build Command**: `yarn build` or `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist`

### Note:
Serverless functions have cold starts, so the first request might be slower.

## Option 4: DigitalOcean App Platform ðŸŒŠ

### Steps:
1. Push to GitHub
2. Go to DigitalOcean â†’ Apps
3. Create new app from GitHub
4. Select this repository
5. DigitalOcean will auto-detect Node.js

---

## Environment Variables

All platforms will automatically use:
- `PORT` - Set by the platform
- `NODE_ENV=production` - For production optimizations

No additional environment variables needed! The service uses Bluesky credentials from the client requests.

---

## Custom Domain Setup

After deployment, you can add a custom domain:

1. **Railway**: Project Settings â†’ Domains â†’ Add Custom Domain
2. **Render**: Service Settings â†’ Custom Domains
3. **Vercel**: Project Settings â†’ Domains
4. **DigitalOcean**: App Settings â†’ Domains

---

## Health Check

All deployments include a health check endpoint at `/health` that platforms use to monitor your service.

## Troubleshooting Deployments

### Build Failures
If you encounter build failures on deployment platforms:

1. **Manual Render Configuration**: If Render auto-detects incorrectly, manually set:
   - **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build`
   - **Start Command**: `npm start`
   - **Node Version**: 20.x (in Environment settings)

2. **Try yarn instead of npm**: Yarn often has better dependency resolution
   ```bash
   # In your build command, use:
   yarn install && yarn build
   # Instead of:
   npm ci && npm run build
   ```

3. **Check Node.js version**: Ensure the platform uses Node.js 18+
4. **Verify dependencies**: Make sure both `dependencies` and `devDependencies` are properly installed
5. **Use npm install instead of npm ci**: If `package-lock.json` has issues, use:
   ```bash
   npm install && npm run build
   ```

### Local Build Testing
Test your build locally before deploying:
```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install  # or npm install

# Build the project
yarn build    # or npm run build

# Test the production build
node dist/index.js
```
