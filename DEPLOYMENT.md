## Environment Variables

All platforms will automatically use:
- `PORT` - Set by the platform
- `NODE_ENV=production` - For production optimizations

No additional environment variables needed! The service uses Bluesky credentials from the client requests.

---

## Custom Domain Setup

After deployment, you can add a custom domain:

1. **Railway**: Project Settings â†’ Domains â†’ Add Custom Domain
2. **Render**: Service Settings â†’ Custom Domains
3. **Vercel**: Project Settings â†’ Domains
4. **DigitalOcean**: App Settings â†’ Domains

---

## Health Check

All deployments include a health check endpoint at `/health` that platforms use to monitor your service.

## Troubleshooting Deployments

### Build Failures
If you encounter build failures on deployment platforms:

1. **Manual Render Configuration**: If Render auto-detects incorrectly, manually set:
   - **Build Command**: `yarn install && yarn build`
   - **Start Command**: `yarn start`  
   - **Node Version**: 20.x (in Environment settings)

2. **Manual Railway Configuration**: Railway works best with npm. Go to Settings â†’ Deploy:
   - **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build`
   - **Start Command**: `npm start`
   - **Node Version**: 18.x or 20.x (in Variables)

3. **Manual DigitalOcean Configuration**: If needed, go to App Settings â†’ Components:
   - **Build Command**: `yarn install && yarn build`
   - **Run Command**: `yarn start`
   - **Node Version**: 18.x or 20.x

4. **Fallback to npm if yarn fails**: Only if yarn is unavailable on the platform:
   ```bash
   # Fallback build command:
   npm install && npm run build
   ```

4. **Check Node.js version**: Ensure the platform uses Node.js 18+
5. **Verify dependencies**: Make sure both `dependencies` and `devDependencies` are properly installed

### Local Build Testing
Test your build locally before deploying:
```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install  # or npm install

# Build the project
yarn build    # or npm run build

# Test the production build
node dist/index.js
```
